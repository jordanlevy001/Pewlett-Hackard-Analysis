# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to prepare Pewlett Hackard for when its employees retire. It's important to understand and estimate which positions are likely to lose employees to retirement so we can begin to fill those positions or train/mentor younger employees to fill those roles. For this analysis, we assisted Bobby with determining the number of retiring employees by title as well as determining the employees who were eligibile for the mentorship program.

## Results

Analysis results:
- A list of the most recent job titles of every potentially retiring employee, their first and last name, and employee number was summarized in a table called: unique_titles
- The number of retiring employees for each position title was counted and summarized in a table called: retiring_titles
- A mentorship_eligibility table was created to display current employees (born in 1965) who are eligible for mentorship
- There are thousands of employees in various positions who are eligible for mentorship
Pewlett Hackard will begin a mentorship program due to a large number of employees at retirement age.

## Summary

About 82,000 employees are approaching retirement. About 75% of those employees are in senior engineering and senior staff positions. The mentorship program will be a very useful tool in preparing younger employees to replace those that are approaching retirement. There are only two managers approaching retirement but their positions

There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in most departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. There are about twice as many senior engineers as engineers. And there are more than twice as many senior staff employees as staff employees. Additionally, there are thousands of employees (born in 1965) who could enter the mentorship program as mentees. If more mentees are needed, we could expand the pre-requisite for the mentorship program to include slightly older workers --workers born between 1965-1970 for example.
