# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
### The purpose of this analysis was to prepare Pewlett Hackard for when its employees begin to retire. It's important to understand and estimate which positions are likely to lose employees to retirement so we can begin to fill those positions or train younger employees to fill those roles. For this analysis, we assisted Bobby with determining the number of retitiring employees by title as well as determine the employees who were eligibile for the mentorship program. Thus this analysis will allow us to estimate how many people could participate in the mentorship program.
